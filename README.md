**Key Features of Transformers:**
- **Self-Attention Mechanism:** This mechanism enables the model to weigh the relevance of different words in a sequence, regardless of their position, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of context.
- **Positional Encoding:** Transformers incorporate positional information into the input embeddings to maintain the order of words.
- **Parallel Processing:** Unlike LSTMs, Transformers process entire sequences simultaneously, leading to more efficient training and faster development.

**Advantages in Headline Generation:**
- **Global Context Understanding:** Transformers can capture complex relationships between words across the entire sequence, leading to more nuanced and contextually accurate headlines.
- **Efficient Training:** The ability to process sequences in parallel reduces training times, making Transformers more efficient for large datasets and quicker iterations.

### ðŸ›  Usage

1. **Training the Models**:
   - Open `Transformer_Headline_Generator.ipynb` to see the implementation and training of the Transformer model.

2. **Generating Headlines**:
   - After training, use the wrapper classes to generate headlines. These classes handle everything internally, making it easy to test the models.
   - Example usage:
     ```python
     num_words_to_generate = 10
     start_prompt = "Blockchain"
     
     # Initialize the headline generators
     lstm_model = LSTMHeadlineGenerator()
     transformer_model = TransformersHeadlineGenerator()

     # Generate headlines
     headline_lstm = lstm_model.generate_text_from_prompt(start_prompt, num_words_to_generate)
     headline_transformer = transformer_model.generate_text_from_prompt(start_prompt, num_words_to_generate)

     print("ðŸ“° LSTM Headline:", headline_lstm) -> 'Blockchain Technology And Its Impact On The Financial Industry And Opportunities'
     print("ðŸ“° Transformer Headline:", headline_transformer) ->  'blockchain technology in the manufacturing : opportunities and conservation'
     ```
